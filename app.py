        Scoring Guidelines:
        - Clarity (0-10): How clear and understandable is the writing?
        - Structure (0-10): How well organized and logical is the document?
        - Completeness (0-10): How complete are the requirements and specifications?
        - Ambiguity (0-10): How many unclear or vague statements exist? (lower score = more ambiguous)
        - Stakeholder Consideration (0-10): How well does it consider different stakeholders?
        - Technical Depth (0-10): How thorough are the technical requirements?
        - Feasibility (0-10): How realistic and achievable are the requirements?
        - Business Impact Alignment (0-10): How well aligned is it with business objectives?

        Analysis Instructions:
        1. Look for standard PRD sections: Problem Statement, Solution Overview, Requirements, Success Metrics, Timeline, Resources, etc.
        2. Identify missing critical sections that would improve the PRD
        3. Generate specific, actionable improvement tasks
        4. Consider technical feasibility and business impact
        5. Assess potential risks and suggest mitigations
        6. Recommend appropriate PRD template type

        Rules:
        - Respond with valid JSON only
        - Be specific and actionable in feedback
        - All scores must be between 0 and 10
        - Provide at least 3 strengths and 3 areas for improvement
        - Include 2-5 missing sections if applicable
        - Include 3-6 action items
        - Do not wrap JSON in markdown code blocks
